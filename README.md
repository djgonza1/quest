# quest
This project is a prototype for a online multiplayer card game built on top of the Unity3D engine.

The project is a work in progress and not fully playable yet. Some of the current integrated functionality includes:
-Setup for core gameplay loop. Player can drag and drop cards to the battle field against a barebones AI player.
-Setup for asset management including loading prefabs from asset bundles
-Client and Server are able to communicate with eachother

Most of the code examples can be found in quest/Assets/Silvermine/Scripts/

The game is "playable" in the Unity editor by playing the scene "start_scene" and pressing the "VS AI" button. Click and drag cards to the center of the screen to play them and the AI will respond by playing a card. Online functionality is WIP.
